My first collision function uses linear probing and my second function uses quadratic probing.
They take the modulo of the mapsize to make sure that it doesn't get out of bounds and they both
increment collisions as well.

My first hash function takes the ascii value of the first two and last two characters in the string and adds them
all together. My second hash function takes the ascii values of all of the letters in the string and adds them together
then doubles that value.
